# Complexity Rating Guide

This guide defines standard complexity ratings used across all specification types.

## Implementation Complexity

- **Low**: Basic understanding required to implement the pattern or technology.
- **Medium**: Moderate expertise needed and multiple components involved.
- **High**: Advanced knowledge and significant design effort required.

## Detection Complexity

- **Simple**: Straightforward keyword or pattern matching.
- **Moderate**: Requires context analysis and cross-file relationships.
- **Complex**: Deep semantic understanding or flow analysis needed.

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal**: Operations with constant or logarithmic cost (O(1), O(log n)).
- **Moderate**: Linear or linearithmic performance (O(n), O(n log n)).
- **Significant**: Quadratic or worse complexity (O(nÂ²) or higher).

Use these ratings in YAML specifications and documentation to maintain
consistent descriptions of implementation effort, detection difficulty,
and expected performance.
